# The League of Robot Runners Benchmark Archive

Welcome to the League of Robot Runners Benchmark Archive!
At the end of each year's competition, we release the benchmark instances and best-known solutions for the competition. This allows researchers and newcomers to compare their algorithms on our problem instances and build upon the best-known solutions and algorithms that created these solutions.

## What to find here

For each year's League of Robot Runners competition, you will find:
- Evaluation benchmark instances that were used in any round of the competition.
- Best-known solutions for the evaluation benchmark instances.
- Example instances that are released with the start-kit.
- Benchmark generator (if available).

Under each year's folder, you will find a table that lists all the best-known solutions with links to the solutions and the implementation that created the solution.
